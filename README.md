# Statistical-Computing
R package for implementing several  statistical computing methods and optimization algorithms including:

Cholesky Decomposition
Ridge Regression
Gradient Descent
Damped Newton?s Method 
Quasi-Newton Method
MM algorithm and proximal gradient algorithm for matrix completion

and so on ...

I learned and made these from my course Statistical Computing.
